# Claude AI Agent Configuration

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This file is maintained for **backward compatibility only**.

The primary configuration file for all AI agents (including Claude) has been moved to `AGENTS.md`.

---

## Primary Rule

**MANDATORY:** Before performing any tasks or operations on this project, you **MUST**:

1. **Load `AGENTS.md`** - This is the central configuration file containing all agent rules and guidelines
2. **Follow all instructions** in `AGENTS.md`, including loading project-specific rules from `.agents/rules/*`

---

## Migration Notice

If you're referencing `CLAUDE.md`:
- Please update your workflows to reference `AGENTS.md` instead
- `CLAUDE.md` may be deprecated in future versions
- All new rules and updates will be added to `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/rules/*`

---

## Quick Start

👉 **Go to [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)** to get started.
