# LEARNINGS — Durable streams in valtron

_No implementation yet. This file is seeded at spec creation and updated after each milestone.
See `.agents/skills/specifications-management/skill.md`._

## Key finding (creation, 2026-10-30)

Valtron already owns every piece a durable stream needs, but they are not named as one thing:

- `Stream::Wait` + `WakeableStream` is the long-poll tail.
- `Stream::Spread` is the batch append (the protocol's JSON-array flattening).
- `Stream::Pending(P)` is the pending-progress context.
- `into_next_stream` / `into_future_stream` are the async consumption seam.
- `#[task]` is the idempotent-producer state machine.
- `Ctx` (rule 11) is the storage injection point.

The spec does not invent a new runtime. It names the contract and binds those pieces to a small
`DurableStreamStore` trait, so a reader, a writer, a fork and five backends share one shape.

## Load-bearing decisions (creation, 2026-10-30)

- **Offsets are opaque and ordered, never parsed.** Only the store builds offsets. This is what
  lets a file backend, an R2 segment key and a DO SQLite sequence share one reader.
- **A refusal, never a gap.** `StoreError::Trimmed` is the only answer to a dropped offset. This
  mirrors the "a refusal, never a gap" rule the edge notes already record for `foundation_log`.
- **Acknowledgement has two levels.** `Accepted` (durable at the tail) and `Sealed` (durable in
  the sealed object) are both configuration, matching the edge-data "acknowledge at the tail"
  lever.
- **Storage is injected, never global.** The DST layer swaps an in-memory store with a simulated
  clock and a seeded RNG, so any run replays from its seed.
