- valtron `Ctx` and `foundation_http::ContextBag` are the same idea: a type map, a clock and a
  shared `ChaCha8Rng`. Only `Ctx` has a config, and only the bag uses an `RwLock`. The bag
  also has an `unsafe impl Send/Sync` that the compiler does not need.
- `SimulatedClock` cannot move to `foundation_context`. Its `advance` must wake the parked
  executors (#305), and that wake is crate-private in `foundation_core`. A listener hook would
  let a caller build a simulated clock that does not wake them.
- `foundation_connectrpc::Ctx` is emitted by two generators (`foundation_macros` and
  `foundation_connectrpc_codegen`). The rename to `RpcCtx` must change both and regenerate.
- About 600 `dyn Clock` sites exist outside tests (2026-11-09). `foundation_ai` (124),
  `foundation_deployment_platform` (81), `foundation_auth` (80) and `foundation_nativeapis`
  (73) are the largest.
- Feature 01: `SimulatedClock::new` reads `Instant::now()` for its base. That read stayed in
  `foundation_core/src/valtron/ctx.rs`, so the time-source allowlist needs an entry for that
  file, next to the new entry for `foundation_context/src/lib.rs`.
- Feature 01: `cargo fmt --all` rewrites files in other crates (`foundation_connectrpc_codegen`
  `generator.rs`, `foundation_openapi` `unified/emit.rs`). Those files were already not
  formatted. Revert them, or format only the crate you changed.
- Feature 01: `foundation_context` has no default features. Its wasm build compiles with no
  time backend chosen, so each consumer must forward `wasm-bindgen` or `host-abi`.
