# Spec 70 learnings

_What an agent learned that the next agent needs. Newest first._

Feature 01 (valtron parking) is on ewe-studios/ewe_platform#163. The two blocking findings and
the minor finding from review are now fixed on `fix/io-01-valtron-parking`, each with a test:

- `TaskStatus::from_stream` and the async stream lenses no longer register a callback per poll.
  They announce an async consumer with the new idempotent `WakeableStream::announce` (no callback)
  before the first pull; the real wake is still registered only when a pull comes back empty.
- A producer waiting on a full queue now replaces its space wake with `WakeRegistry::replace`
  (clear then push one), so stale callbacks no longer pile up across retries of a full push.
- `NotifyQueue::pop` gates `space.fire()` on `WakeRegistry::has_waiters()`, so a pop with no
  waiting producer takes no wake lock.

`announce` is forwarded by every forwarding combinator and by `DrivenStreamIterator` (multi);
buffering combinators keep the default no-op. Three new tests in `tests/valtron/wakeable_stream.rs`
pin each fix: `from_stream_does_not_accumulate_noop_wakes`, `register_space_wake_replaces_not_accumulates`,
and `pop_wakes_a_waiting_producer`.

What the earlier work fixed: the smol/tokio hang (default features only, `DrivenStreamIterator::wake`),
`ThreadedIterFuture` parking, and the first empty read no longer blocking.

The agent also recorded one older limitation in the backlog: a task that stays parked for a long
time can still leave an async consumer with nothing to wake it. The old code had the same problem.

- 2026-10-28 (feature 01 review fixes): the wake registry now keeps a `pending: AtomicUsize`
  count updated under the same mutex as the callback vec, so `has_waiters`/`pending_len` never
  disagree with the list. `register` and `replace` both update the count while holding the lock;
  `fire` stores 0. `replace` is `clear` + `push`, which is what stops a full-queue producer from
  accumulating stale callbacks. `announce` is the idempotent, no-callback twin of `wake`: it is
  forwarded wherever `wake` is forwarded, and left as a no-op on buffering combinators.
- 2026-10-28 (feature 01): run valtron tests in BOTH feature sets: `--features multi` and the
  default (no `multi`). The `smol/tokio_drives_parked_future_task` hang only shows without
  `multi`. Cause: the single-thread `DrivenStreamIterator` (`executors/non_sendables.rs`) drives the
  engine inside `next`. Priming it (registering a wake before the first pull) switched the inner
  `NotifyQueueStreamIterator` to non-blocking mode, so an empty pull answered `Wait`; the consumer
  then parked on a queue wake. But a parked task is made runnable by a foreign thread flipping a
  readiness signal, which pushes nothing and fires no queue wake, and nobody called `next` again.
  Evidence: a trace showed two engine drives within 30 us, then silence while the 30 ms thread
  fired. Fix: that `wake` registers on the queue only and leaves the inner blocking. The deeper
  fix (readiness sources that can register a wake) is in `docs/bug-backlog.md` section 4.
- 2026-10-28 (feature 01): `ThreadedIterFuture` cannot have a full queue when the future's `Err` is
  pushed (nothing is pushed before it; the smallest queue holds 2), so the old `let _ = push(Err)`
  could not lose the error in practice; the error test pins delivery only.

- 2026-10-28 (from the PR #160 work): `H2Connection::flush_write` used `write_all`, so a
  `WouldBlock` part-way re-sent the already-written prefix and corrupted the HTTP/2 frame
  stream. Any non-blocking writer must track how much it wrote.
- 2026-10-28: the shared reactor's drain thread must request an executor resume after it latches
  events, or parked tasks wait for the idle back-off (up to 100 ms).
