# Spec 70 learnings

_What an agent learned that the next agent needs. Newest first._

- 2026-10-28 (feature 01): run valtron tests in BOTH feature sets: `--features multi` and the
  default (no `multi`). The `smol/tokio_drives_parked_future_task` hang only shows without
  `multi`. Cause: the single-thread `DrivenStreamIterator` (`executors/non_sendables.rs`) drives the
  engine inside `next`. Priming it (registering a wake before the first pull) switched the inner
  `NotifyQueueStreamIterator` to non-blocking mode, so an empty pull answered `Wait`; the consumer
  then parked on a queue wake. But a parked task is made runnable by a foreign thread flipping a
  readiness signal, which pushes nothing and fires no queue wake, and nobody called `next` again.
  Evidence: a trace showed two engine drives within 30 us, then silence while the 30 ms thread
  fired. Fix: that `wake` registers on the queue only and leaves the inner blocking. The deeper
  fix (readiness sources that can register a wake) is in `docs/bug-backlog.md` section 4.
- 2026-10-28 (feature 01): `ThreadedIterFuture` cannot have a full queue when the future's `Err` is
  pushed (nothing is pushed before it; the smallest queue holds 2), so the old `let _ = push(Err)`
  could not lose the error in practice; the error test pins delivery only.

- 2026-10-28 (from the PR #160 work): `H2Connection::flush_write` used `write_all`, so a
  `WouldBlock` part-way re-sent the already-written prefix and corrupted the HTTP/2 frame
  stream. Any non-blocking writer must track how much it wrote.
- 2026-10-28: the shared reactor's drain thread must request an executor resume after it latches
  events, or parked tasks wait for the idle back-off (up to 100 ms).
