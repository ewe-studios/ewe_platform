# Project Specifications

## Overview
This directory contains all project specifications and requirements. Each specification represents a significant feature, enhancement, or change to the project.

## How Specifications Work

1. **Requirements-First**: Before work begins, main agent discusses requirements with user
2. **Documentation**: Requirements and tasks are documented in numbered specification directories
3. **User Approval**: User must explicitly approve and request implementation
4. **Agent Reading**: Agents MUST read requirements.md, tasks.md, and relevant feature files
5. **Status Verification**: Agents MUST verify completion status by searching the codebase
6. **Task Updates**: Agents MUST update tasks.md as work progresses
7. **Status Accuracy**: Agents MUST ensure status reflects actual implementation

## Specification Guidelines

### For Agents
When working with specifications:
1. **Read main files first**: requirements.md AND tasks.md
2. **Check for features/**: If present, read relevant feature.md and tasks.md
3. **Check for templates/**: Read any templates referenced in requirements
4. **Verify before assuming**: Search the codebase to confirm task status
5. **Update as you go**: Mark tasks complete only when truly done
6. **Keep counts accurate**: Update frontmatter in tasks.md files
7. **Commit regularly**: Follow git workflow rules

### For Users
This dashboard provides:
- **Quick overview**: See all specifications at a glance
- **Status tracking**: Monitor progress on each specification
- **Navigation**: Links to detailed requirements and tasks
- **Transparency**: Clear view of what's done, in progress, and pending
- **Feature breakdown**: Understanding of complex specification structure
